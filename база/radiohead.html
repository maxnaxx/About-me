        <h1>Radiohead</h1>
        <h2>No Surprises</h2>
        A heart that's full up like a landfill <br>
        A job that slowly kills you <br>
        Bruises that won't heal <br>
        You look so tired, unhappy
        Bring down the government <br>
        They don't, they don't speak for us <br>
        I'll take a quiet life <br>
        A handshake of carbon monoxide <br>
        <br>
        And no alarms and no surprises <br>
        No alarms and no surprises <br>
        No alarms and no surprises <br>
        Silent, silent <br>
        <br>
        This is my final fit <br>
        My final bellyache with <br>
        <br>
        No alarms and no surprises <br>
        No alarms and no surprises <br>
        No alarms and no surprises, please <br>
        <br>
        Such a pretty house <br>
        And such a pretty garden <br>
        <br>
        No alarms and no surprises (get me out of here) <br>
        No alarms and no surprises (get me out of here) <br>
        No alarms and no surprises, please (get me out of here) <br>
        <br>
